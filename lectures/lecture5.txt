== Factor Prices, Output Prices, and Levels of Factors (cont.) ==
* We have a relationship among input (factor) prices and output prices and the levels of factors used in production:
* '''Stolper-Samuelson theorem''': if the relative price of a good increases, then the real wage or real lending/ renting rate of the factor used intensively in the production of that good increases, while the real wage or real lending/renting rate of the other factor decreases.
    * Under competition, the real wage/rate is equal to the marginal productivity of the factor.
    * The marginal productivity of a factor typically decreases as the level of that factor used in production increases.

== Factor Prices, Output Prices, and Levels of Factors (cont.) ==
* We have a theory that predicts changes in the distribution of income when the relative price of goods changes, say because of trade.
* An increase in the relative price of cloth, $P_C /P_F$, is predicted to:
    * raise income of workers relative to that of landowners, $w/r$.
        * because of cloth sector using labor more intensively
    * raise the ratio of land to labor services, $T/L$, used in both industries, as land becomes relatively cheaper
    * raise the marginal productivity of labor in both industries and lower the marginal productivity of land in both industries, as more land and less labor is used
    * raise the real income of workers and \textit{lower the real income of land owners}.
% could give some intuition, why (real income in terms of both goods?)

== Factor Prices, Output Prices, Levels of Factors, and Levels of Output ==
* An economy with a \textit{high ratio of land to labor services} is predicted to have a \textit{high output of food} relative to cloth and a \textit{low price of food} relative to cloth.
    * It will be relatively efficient at (have a comparative advantage in) producing food.
* An economy is predicted to be relatively efficient at producing goods that are intensive in the factors of production in which the country is relatively well endowed.
* (These we will show later.)



== Opening up to trade ==
* If a land abundant country opens up to trade, this
 * raises the relative price of food to cloth,
 * raises the relative reward of land to labor.
...
* ''Abundant factors gain from opening to trade''.

== Summary ==
* There are ''always'' distributional effects of trade between
  * different factors (Heckscher--Ohlin model)
  * later: different industries (specific factor model)
  * later: different firms (Melitz model)
* These may lead to inequality,
* and provide a political-economoy motivation for trade protection.
