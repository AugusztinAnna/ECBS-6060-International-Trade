= Lecture 1: Gains from trade =

== Structure of the course ==
* What can we learn from trade theory?
    1. Every country gains from trade.
    2. We trade too little.
    3. Someone always loses from trade.

= What trade theory is about =
== What trade theory is about ==
* Trade theory is applied general equilibrium theory.
* The agents are countries, represented by production functions (sets), endowments, and preferences.
* These lead to ''excess demand'' functions that tell us the pattern and volume of trade at given world prices.
* World prices will be such that ''world markets'' clear (world net trade is zero).


== Where we depart from basic GE ==
* We will introduce some important modifications to standard GE.
    * Trade/transport costs.
    * Increasing returns to scale.
    * Imperfect competition.
    * Heterogeneity within countries.

== Why countries trade ==
* Agents trade because they want to exchange goods.
* Countries will exchange goods if they are ''different''.
* Countries may differ in
    1. Technology
    2. Endowments
    4. Preferences
    3. Income

== Different preferences? ==
* Across countries, there is much less variation in demand than in supply.
* For these reasons, we focus on trade models around supply differences.
    * But see discussion of trade costs.

= Production theory recap =
== Technology ==
* Production technology represent the set of feasible transformations of goods into one another.
* In trade, we focus on a restricted setup.
* Vector of goods $\mathbf x$
* Vector of primary inputs $\mathbf v$
* Production function
\[
\mathbf x = f(\mathbf v)
\]

== Production function ==
We assume the following properties of $f(v)$
* constant return to scale
* quasi-concave
* (twice continuously differentiable)

== Profit maximization ==
\[
\max_{\mathbf x,\mathbf v} p\mathbf x-w\mathbf v
\]
\[
\text{s.t. }\mathbf x=f(\mathbf v)
\]

== ==
\longfigure{PPF}{Maximizing revenue given inputs}

== Cost minimization ==
* The dual side of the problem is equivalent.
\[
\min_{\mathbf v} w\mathbf v
\]
\[
\text{s.t. }\mathbf x=f(\mathbf v)
\]
* The solution to this problem gives us a cost function
\[
C(w,\mathbf x) = c(w)\mathbf x,
\]
where the last eq follows from CRS.
* $c(w)$ is the ''unit cost function''.

== Properties of the unit cost function ==
We will use a number of properties:
1. homogeneous of degree one
2. concave in $w$
3. derivatives wrt $w$ give unit input requirements

== Graphical representation ==

== The revenue function ==
* Suppose you have access to many technologies ($f$ is vector-valued).
* Maximize total revenue subject to a limited amount of inputs.
\[\max_x p\mathbf x\]
\[
\text{s.t. }\mathbf x=f(\mathbf v)
\]
* The solution gives the ''revenue function'':
\[
r(p,\mathbf v).
\]
== Properties of the revenue function ==
We will use a number of properties:
1. homogeneous of degree one in $p$
2. convex in $p$
3. concave in $\mathbf v$
3. derivatives wrt $p$ give supply


= Consumer choice recap =
== Utility maximization ==
\[\max_{\mathbf x} u(\mathbf x)\]
\[
\text{s.t. }p\mathbf x=e
\]

== Expenditure minimization ==
* The dual side of the problem is equivalent.
\[
\min_{\mathbf x} p\mathbf x
\]
\[
\text{s.t. }u(\mathbf x)=u
\]
* The solution to this problem gives us an expenditure function
\[
e(p,u).
\]
* For homothetic preferences, we have
\[
e(p,u) = e(p)g(u).
\]

== Properties of the expenditure function ==
We will use a number of properties:
1. homogeneous of degree one in $p$
2. concave in $p$
3. derivatives wrt $p$ give demand

= Gains from trade =
== Setup ==
The country has 
    * endowments (vector) $\mathbf v$
    * production $\mathbf x$
    * consumption $\mathbf c$
    * prices $p$

== Technology and tastes ==
* Technology is represented by the revenue function
\[
r(p,\mathbf v) = \max_{\mathbf x} p\mathbf x: (\mathbf x,\mathbf v) \text{ feasible}.
\]
* Tastes are represented by the expenditure function
\[
e(p,u) = \min_{\mathbf c} p\mathbf c: u(\mathbf c)=u.
\]

== Supply and demand ==
* Supply of goods (production)
\[
\mathbf x = r_p(p,\mathbf v).
\]
* Demand for goods (consumption)
\[
\mathbf c = e_p(p,u).
\]

== Autarky equilibrium ==
* ''Autarky'': the economy is closed, markets have to clear ''within'' the country.
* In equilibrium, each product market clears,
\[
r_p(p,v) = e_p(p,u).
\]
* Expenditure equals revenue
\[
r(p,v) = e(p,u).
\]
...
* What about factor markets?
* What about profit maximization?
* What about utility maximization?

== Trading equilibrium ==
* We start with the small open economy.
* The world price is $p^w$ (arbitrary).
* At this price, the world buys and sells any amount.
* Net import of goods: 
\[
\mathbf m(p^w) = \mathbf c(p^w) - \mathbf x(p^w).
\]
    
== Equilibrium conditions ==
* Balanced trade:
\[
0 = p^w \mathbf m = p^w(\mathbf c^w-\mathbf x^w) = 
p^w[e_p(p^w,u^w) - r_p(p^w,\mathbf v)].
\]
* Use Euler's theorem:
\[
r(p,\mathbf v) = e(p,u).
\]


== Equilibrium conditions ==
* Goods market are now global, so local markets do not have to clear.
\[
\mathbf m(p^w) = e_p(p,u) - r_p(p,\mathbf v).
\]
* What about factor markets?


== Gains from trade ==
* Let $p^a$ denote the vector of autarky prices.
\begin{align*}
 e(p^w,u^a) & \le p^w\mathbf c^a\\
    &= p^w\mathbf x^a\\
    &\le r(p^w,\mathbf v)\\
    & = e(p^w,u^w)
\end{align*}
...
    1. Definition of the expenditure function.
    2. Autarky equilibrium.
    3. Definition of the revenue function.
    4. Open-economy equilibrium.

== Gains from trade ==
* Since $e(p,u)$ is increasing in $u$,
\[
 u^w\ge u^a.
\]
* Welfare is higher under trade than under autarky.
* Note that this holds for any $p^w$.

== Graphical illustration with PPS ==

== Discussion ==
* Moving from autarky to free trade always improves ''aggregate welfare''.
* What we assumed:
    1. representative consumer/producer
    2. constant returns to scale technologies
    2. perfect competition
    3. no externalities / market failures

== The equivalence of trade and technology ==
* Trade is a "technology" to transform export goods into import goods.
* As long as technology use is voluntary, having access to it is welfare improving.
* There may be important distributional consequences (to be discussed later).
    * Attitudes toward trade should be similar to attitudes toward technical progress.

== Welfare effects of a new technology ==
* Take a linear technology $\mathbf A$ that defines the production set
\[
\mathcal A = \{\mathbf x:\mathbf A\mathbf x\le 0\}.
\]
* Let $\mathcal X$ denote the set of existing technologies.
* How does welfare change with the invention of this new technology?

== Welfare effects of a new technology ==
* Let $\mathbf x\in \mathcal X$ denote the old equilibrium,
$\mathbf x'\in \mathcal X\bigcup \mathcal A$ the new one.
* By revenue maximization,
\[
p'\mathbf x \le p'\mathbf x'.
\]
(If $\mathbf x\in \mathcal X$ then $\mathbf x'\in \mathcal X\bigcup \mathcal A$.)
* For consumers, the old consumption vector $x$ is still attainable at the new prices.
* The fact that they chose a new basket implies that they are better off (weak axiom of revealed preference).

== The equivalence of trade and technology ==
* Clearly, this problem is identical to opening up to trade if $\mathbf A\equiv p^w$.
* Even in a large economy, where $p^w$ depends on $\mathbf m$, the same equivalence holds. (We have not used the linearity of $\mathbf A$ anywhere.)

== 2-country case ==
* Because the country gains for any $p^w$, when two countries open up to trade, ''both gain''.





= Patterns of trade =
== Patterns of trade ==
* How much can we say about the patterns of trade without talking about technologies, endowments, and tastes?
* Quite a lot. These are all summarized in the ''autarky equilibrium price''.
* Deardorff (1980, JPE) derived the law of comparative advantage.

== The law of comparative advantage ==
* Balanced trade:
\[
p^w \mathbf m = 0.
\]
* Autarky consumption is affordable at world prices,
\[
p^w\mathbf c^a \le p^w\mathbf c^w.
\]
Why?
...
    1. $p^w\mathbf x^a\le p^w\mathbf x^w$ by revenue maximization. ($\mathbf x^a$ is still feasible to produce, but brings less revenue.)
    2. $p^w\mathbf x^a=p^w\mathbf c^a$ by market clearing.
    3. $p^w\mathbf x^w=p^w\mathbf c^w$ by balanced trade.


== The law of comparative advantage ==
* Autarky consumption is affordable under free trade, yet not chosen.
* By the ''weak axiom of revealed preference'':
\[
p^a\mathbf c^w > p^a\mathbf c^a.
\]
* By revenue maximization,
\[
p^a\mathbf x^w \le p^a\mathbf x^a.
\]
* Subtract the value of production, $p^ax$:
\[
p^a(\mathbf c^w-\mathbf x^a) = p^a\mathbf m > p^a(\mathbf c^a-\mathbf x^a)=0.
\]
* ''The autarky cost of the net import vector is positive''.
* Equivalently,
\[
(p^a-p^w)\mathbf m > 0.
\]

== The 2-good case ==
* For two goods, this means $m_i>0$ if and only if $p^a_i>p^w_i$.
* The country exports the product which has a low autarky price relative to the world price.
* The country imports the product which has a high autarky price relative to the world price.
* (How does this relate to "Buy cheap, sell dear?")
* There is no such strong conclusion for the $n$-good case. We only have a correlation of prices and trade patterns.


== The 2-country case ==
* In a 2-country world, net imports of country 1 are net exports of country 2:
\[
\mathbf m = -\mathbf M.
\]
* (We use uppercase letters for country 2.)
* The law of CA holds in both countries
\begin{align*}
p^a\mathbf m &>0,\\
P^a\mathbf M &>0.
\end{align*}
* Summing the two
\[
(p^a-P^a) \mathbf m >0.
\]

== The 2$\times$2 case ==
%% redo this
* Goods flow from the low autarky price country to the high autarky price country.
\[
(p^a-P^a) \mathbf m >0.
\]
* Balanced trade
\[
p^w m = 0.
\]
* With two goods, this implies
\[
\frac{p^a_1}{p^a_2} < \frac{p^w_1}{p^w_2} < \frac{P^a_1}{P^a_2}
\]
if good 1 is exported and the reverse if good 2..
* We can narrow down the prices in trade equilibrium.
* Again, no such strong conclusion for the $n$-good case.
