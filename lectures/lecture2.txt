= Lecture 2: Patterns of trade =

== Setup ==
The country has 
    * endowments (vector) $\mathbf v$
    * production $\mathbf x$
    * consumption $\mathbf c$
    * prices $p$

== Technology and tastes ==
* Technology is represented by the revenue function
\[
r(p,\mathbf v) = \max_{\mathbf x} p\mathbf x: (\mathbf x,\mathbf v) \text{ feasible}.
\]
* Tastes are represented by the expenditure function
\[
e(p,u) = \min_{\mathbf c} p\mathbf c: u(\mathbf c)=u.
\]

== Supply and demand ==
* Supply of goods (production)
\[
\mathbf x = r_p(p,\mathbf v).
\]
* Demand for goods (consumption)
\[
\mathbf c = e_p(p,u).
\]

== Autarky equilibrium ==
* ''Autarky'': the economy is closed, markets have to clear ''within'' the country.
* In equilibrium, each product market clears,
\[
r_p(p,v) = e_p(p,u).
\]
* Expenditure equals revenue
\[
r(p,v) = e(p,u).
\]
...
* What about factor markets?
* What about profit maximization?
* What about utility maximization?

== Trading equilibrium ==
* We start with the small open economy.
* The world price is $p^w$ (arbitrary).
* At this price, the world buys and sells any amount.
* Net import of goods: 
\[
\mathbf m(p^w) = \mathbf c(p^w) - \mathbf x(p^w).
\]
    
== Equilibrium conditions ==
* Balanced trade:
\[
0 = p^w \mathbf m = p^w(\mathbf c^w-\mathbf x^w) = 
p^w[e_p(p^w,u^w) - r_p(p^w,\mathbf v)].
\]
* Use Euler's theorem:
\[
r(p,\mathbf v) = e(p,u).
\]


== Equilibrium conditions ==
* Goods market are now global, so local markets do not have to clear.
\[
\mathbf m(p^w) = e_p(p,u) - r_p(p,\mathbf v).
\]
* What about factor markets?


== Gains from trade ==
* Let $p^a$ denote the vector of autarky prices.
\begin{align*}
 e(p^w,u^a) & \le p^w\mathbf c^a\\
    &= p^w\mathbf x^a\\
    &\le r(p^w,\mathbf v)\\
    & = e(p^w,u^w)
\end{align*}
...
    1. Definition of the expenditure function.
    2. Autarky equilibrium.
    3. Definition of the revenue function.
    4. Open-economy equilibrium.

== Gains from trade ==
* Since $e(p,u)$ is increasing in $u$,
\[
 u^w\ge u^a.
\]
* Welfare is higher under trade than under autarky.
* Note that this holds for any $p^w$.

== Graphical illustration with PPS ==

== Discussion ==
* Moving from autarky to free trade always improves ''aggregate welfare''.
* What we assumed:
    1. representative consumer/producer
    2. constant returns to scale technologies
    2. perfect competition
    3. no externalities / market failures

== The equivalence of trade and technology ==
* Trade is a ``technology" to transform export goods into import goods.
* As long as technology use is voluntary, having access to it is welfare improving.
* There may be important distributional consequences (to be discussed later).
    * Attitudes toward trade should be similar to attitudes toward technical progress.

== 2-country case ==
* Because the country gains for any $p^w$, when two countries open up to trade, ''both gain''.





= Patterns of trade =
== Patterns of trade ==
* How much can we say about the patterns of trade without talking about technologies, endowments, and tastes?
* Quite a lot. These are all summarized in the ''autarky equilibrium price''.
* Deardorff (1980, JPE) derived the law of comparative advantage.

== The law of comparative advantage ==
* Balanced trade:
\[
p^w \mathbf m = 0.
\]
* Autarky consumption is affordable at world prices,
\[
p^w\mathbf c^a \le p^w\mathbf c^w.
\]
Why?
...
    1. $p^w\mathbf x^a\le p^w\mathbf x^w$ by revenue maximization. ($\mathbf x^a$ is still feasible to produce, but brings less revenue.)
    2. $p^w\mathbf x^a=p^w\mathbf c^a$ by market clearing.
    3. $p^w\mathbf x^w=p^w\mathbf c^w$ by balanced trade.


== The law of comparative advantage ==
* Autarky consumption is affordable under free trade, yet not chosen.
* By the ''weak axiom of revealed preference'':
\[
p^a\mathbf c^w > p^a\mathbf c^a.
\]
* By revenue maximization,
\[
p^a\mathbf x^w \le p^a\mathbf x^a.
\]
* Subtract the value of production, $p^a\mathbf x^w$ and $p^a \mathbf x^a$:
\[
p^a(\mathbf c^w-\mathbf x^w) = p^a\mathbf m > p^a(\mathbf c^a-\mathbf x^a)=0.
\]
* ''The autarky cost of the net import vector is positive''.
* Equivalently,
\[
(p^a-p^w)\mathbf m > 0.
\]

== The 2-good case ==
* For two goods, this means $m_i>0$ if and only if $p^a_i>p^w_i$.
* The country exports the product which has a low autarky price relative to the world price.
* The country imports the product which has a high autarky price relative to the world price.
* (How does this relate to ``Buy cheap, sell dear?")
* There is no such strong conclusion for the $n$-good case. We only have a correlation of prices and trade patterns.


== The 2-country case ==
* In a 2-country world, net imports of country 1 are net exports of country 2:
\[
\mathbf m = -\mathbf M.
\]
* (We use uppercase letters for country 2.)
* The law of CA holds in both countries
\begin{align*}
p^a\mathbf m &>0,\\
P^a\mathbf M &>0.
\end{align*}
* Summing the two
\[
(p^a-P^a) \mathbf m >0.
\]

== The 2$\times$2 case ==
%% redo this
* Goods flow from the low autarky price country to the high autarky price country.
\[
(p^a-P^a) \mathbf m >0.
\]
* Balanced trade
\[
p^w m = 0.
\]
* With two goods, this implies
\[
\frac{p^a_1}{p^a_2} < \frac{p^w_1}{p^w_2} < \frac{P^a_1}{P^a_2}
\]
if good 1 is exported and the reverse if good 2..
* We can narrow down the prices in trade equilibrium.
* Again, no such strong conclusion for the $n$-good case.

= Trade and welfare =
== Estimable equation ==
* Let $y_i=Y_i/L_i$ denote GDP ''per capita'' of country $i$.
* $T_i=(X_i+M_i)/Y_i$ measures the trade openness of country $i$.
* One way of capturing the benefits of trade is to say that
    * per capita income is increasing in openness.
...
\[
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_i + u_i
\]

== Identification problem ==
* $\beta_1$ should measure the effect of a change in $T_i$ ''holding other factors fixed'' ($u_i$)
* Countries with high $T_i$ have different $u_i$.
    * '''Reverse causality''': richer countries trade more.
    * '''Omitted variables''': institutions, macro policies may affect both $y_i$ and $T_i$.
* Both lead to an '''endogeneity bias'''.
    * Coefficient estimated by OLS does not capture ''causal'' effect.

== Natural experiments ==
* These are events creating variation in openness ''uncorrelated with'' income.
* Two key assumptions:
    1. event (or other variable) correlated with trade
    2. holding trade fixed, uncorrelated with income


== Four natural experiments ==
1. Japan 1851
2. US 1808
2. Suez Canal 1967
3. Air freight 1950--1990


= Law of comparative advantage =
== Empirical tests ==
* It is difficult to test these predictions directly, because autarky prices are a counterfactual construct.
* We rarely see countries both in trade and in autarky with the same technology, endowments and preferences.
* Bernhofen and Brown (2004, JPE): Japan's opening in the 19th century.
* Irwin (2005, RIE): self-imposed trade embargo of the U.S. in 1808.

== The natural experiment of Japan ==
* Japan cut itself off from all trade between 1639 and 1853.
* (Except for a small Dutch trading post off the Nagasaki harbor.)
* At the pressure of Western powers, it opened rapidly between 1853 and 1858.

== Measurement ==
* Autarky: 1851--53 (so that production possibilities and tastes are close to trade period)
* Trade: 1868--75.
* Prices are from merchant's books.

== Results ==
* Autarky prices of export goods were generally lower than trade prices.
* Autarky prices of import goods were generally higher than trade prices.
* The autarky cost of the net import vector was negative.
* Confirming the law of comparative advantage.
* Bernhofen and Brown (2005, AER): autarky may have cost up to 8--9\% of Japan's GDP

== The natural experiment in the U.S. ==
* In 1807, U.S. Congress enacted an embargo on maritime trade.
    1. To protect American vessels and crew from British (and French) harassment.
    2. To put economic costs on Britain.
* The embargo was widely observed and almost "sealed off" the U.S. from the ROW.
* Domestic prices of export and import goods have changed substantially.
