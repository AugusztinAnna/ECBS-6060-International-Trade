= Comparative statics of the Heckscher-Ohlin model =
== The Rybczynski theorem ==
* Let us conduct some comparative statics.
* Suppose we are inside the FPE set, and we increase one factor, while holding the others fixed.
* If factor prices are fixed, what gives?
* This exercise gives us the Rybczynski theorem.

== Two goods ==
=== The Rybczynski theorem ===
If we increase the abundance of one factor, the sector that uses it intensively will expand ''more than proportionally'', the other will ''shrink''.

== Multiple goods ==
* Let us increase $V_1$ by $\delta>0$. The other factors remain unchanged.
* As long as we remain inside the FPE set,
\[
\sum_i a_{ni}(w) \Delta x_i = \Delta V_n.
\]
* But $\Delta V_n=\delta>0$ for $n=1$ and $0$ otherwise.
* The vector of $\Delta X_i$ has to be such that this holds.
* Notice that $\Delta V_n$ is a weighted sum of the $\Delta X_i$s, with different (but positive) weights for each $n$.
* We show that ''some'' industry expands ($\Delta X_i>0$) and ''some'' industry shrinks ($\Delta X_j<0$).

== Proof ==
* Prove by contradiction. We rule out
  1. $\Delta X_i=0$ for all $i$,
  1. $\Delta X_i\ge0$ for all $i$,
  2. and $\Delta X_i\le0$ for all $i$.
* Then it must be the case that $\Delta X_i>0$ for some $i$ and $\Delta X_j<0$ for some $j$.

== Proof ==
1. If $\Delta X_i\equiv 0$, then $\Delta V_n\equiv 0$, and we cannot have $\Delta V_1=\delta>0$.
2. If $\Delta X_i\ge 0$ and $\Delta X_i\neq 0$, then there has to be some (maybe more) $i$ for which $\Delta X_i>0$. But then demand for all factors used in these industries increases:
\[
 \Delta V_n>0\text{ for all $n$ such that }a_{ni}>0.
\]
We cannot have $\Delta V_n=0$ for all $n>1$.
3. The same argument can be used for $\Delta X_i\le 0$.

== Intuition ==
* If one factor expands, so will some of the sectors.
* These sectors put extra demand on the rest of the factors.
* To counteract the increasing factor demand, some sectors will shrink to restore the equilibrium.
* (Given that the other sectors have shrunk, the expanding sector can expand even more.)
* How is this different from the closed economy case?

== Closed economy ==
* It was key to the proof that $a_{ni}$s do not change.
* In a closed economy, these will respond, too.
* If a factor increases, its reward will typically fall.
* Then each sector will change its ''technique'' to use it more intensively, thus absorbing more of it.

== Illustration: an extreme case ==
* Suppose that preferences are Leontief so that $\alpha$ does not depend on $p$.
* In closed economy, $\mathbf X^j = \mathbf \alpha Y^j$, so the structure of production is also ''fixed'' in equilibrium.
* Factor market clearing,
\[
\sum_i a_{ni}(w^j) x_i^j = V_n^j
\]
can only happen through changes in $a_{ni}$.

== An empirical illustration: The  Mariel boatlift ==
* David Card, 1990. The Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market. ILRR.
* From May to September 1980, some 125,000 were permitted to leave Cuba. Most ended up in Miami.
* This inflow of immigrants represented a 7\% increase in the Miami labor force.
...
* Still, wages and unemployment rates hardly changed. Why?

= Without FPE =
== Without FPE ==
* What if the endowment vector is outside the FPE set?
* Clearly, factor rewards will be unequal.
* Countries will use different techniques, and we cannot use the methods above to talk about the pattern of trade.
