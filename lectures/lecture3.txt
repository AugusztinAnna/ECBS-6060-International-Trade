= Lecture 3: The gravity equation of trade volumes. Trade costs. = 

== Outline ==
* Today we start with our second question:
    * Why do we trade so little?
* We first establish the empirical patterns (little relative to what?).
* Then we turn to ''trade costs'' as a potential reason for the missing trade.
    * New models help quantify trade frictions and the gains from trade.

= The missing trade =
== The missing trade ==
* Although trade has increased dramatically over time, it is till lower than predicted by theory.
* We use two benchmarks:
    1. frictionless trade with complete specialization
    3. domestic vs foreign trade




= The gravity equation =
== Deriving the gravity equation ==
* We can derive the gravity equation of trade volumes from any model that features complete specialization. 
* ''Complete specialization'' means that each good is produced in ''only one country''. 

== Preferences ==
* With identical, homothetic preferences and free trade:
\[
 e(p,u^j) = u^j P(p).
\]
* Demand for good $i$ in country $j$:
\[
 c_i^j(p) = u^j P_i(p).
\]
* Substituting out $u^j$:
\[
 c_i^j(p) = E^j\frac{P_i(p)}{\sum_{i'} p_{i'}P_{i'}(P)} \equiv E^j b_i(p).
\]

    1. Each country consumes the goods in the same proportion, $b_i(p)$.
    2. The income elasicity of each good is 1 for each country.

== The supply side ==
* Because of complete specialization, each good is only produced in one country.
* Suppose good $i$ is produced in country $j$:
\[
 \sum_{k\in J} c_i^k = x_i^j.
\]
* How much of this good does country $k$ buy?
\[
 \frac{c_i^k}{\sum_{k'\in J} c_i^{k'}} = \frac{E^k}{E^w}.
\]
* The export of good $i$ from country $j$ to country $k$:
\[
 x_i^{j\to k} = \frac{E^j}{E^w}x_i^j.
\]

== The volume of trade ==
* First we multiply by $p_i$ to get the value of the trade flow.
* Let us add up all the goods that country $j$ produces:
\[
T^{j\to k} = \sum_i p_i x_i^{j\to k} = \frac{E^j}{E^w}\sum_ip_ix_i^j = \frac{E^jE^k}{E^w}.
\]
* This is exactly the gravity equation.

== Reasons for complete specialization ==
=== Armington assumption ===
Armington (1969) assumes that consumers value each country's production ''as separate goods''. Complete specialization by assumption.

=== Krugman model ===
Because firms choose to differentiate their products (to economize on fixed costs), complete specialization is ''endogenously'' obtained.

=== Ricardian models ===
In Dornbusch, Fisher, Samuelson (1977) [see later], each good is only produced in one country.




== Frictionless gravity ==
* The gravity equation without trade costs:
\[
T^{j\to k} = \frac{E^jE^k}{E^w}.
\]
* We can measure all four variables involved.
* We can then see whether the LHS of the gravity equation is lower than the RHS.
* Let us look at a simple example.

== Exports of Hungary ==
* In 2006, the Hungarian industry sold EUR 86 billion worth of manufactured goods.
    * 40 billion of this went to Hungary,
    * 46 billion were exported.
* Are these numbers consistent with gravity?

== Income differences ==
* Total (nominal) GDP of Hungary was around \$138 billion.
* Total (nominal) GDP of the world was around \$54.6 trillion.
* The rest of the world has a 0.9975 share in world income.
* They should buy 0.9975 fraction of Hungarian output.
    * EUR 85.78 billion

== Missing trade ==
* Relative to this 85.8 billion, only 46 billion is exported.
* 47\% of trade is ''missing''.




= A model with trade costs =
== A model with trade costs ==
* Take a differentiated good model.
* Complete specialization.
* But trade is costly.

== How to model trade costs? ==
* Shipping a good from country $j$ to $k$ costs $\tau^{jk}$.
* But in what units?
* Standard assumption (due to Samuelson, 1954): in units of the good being shipped, "iceberg cost".

== Iceberg shipping costs ==
* Only a certain ''fraction'' of the good arrives at the destination.
    * iceberg melts
    * grain spills
    * china breaks
    * goods get stole by pirates
    * fuel trucks consume fuel
* To ensure that 1 unit arrives, one has to ship $\tau^{jk}>1$ units of the good.

== Why this assumption is convenient ==
1. Transportation impacts no other market.
2. Implies a ''proportional'' (rather than additive) increase in the good's price.
    * Works well with constant markups
    * and isoelastic demand.
    
== Consumer vs producer prices ==
* ''Consumer price'' is \[\tilde p = \tau p.\]

== Demand with iceberg trade costs ==
* Consumers value all products symmetrically.
    * But prices are now assymetric.
* Utility:
\[
U = \left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^\alpha\right]^{1/\alpha}\text{ }0<\alpha<1
\]
* The demand for product $i$:
\[
x_i = E \frac{(\tau_i p_i)^{-\varepsilon}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\tau_j p_j)^{1-\varepsilon}}
\]


== Deriving the gravity equation ==
* Suppose each country produces one differentiated variety (Armington assumption).
    * Same results with monopolistic competition (Krugman).
    * Similar results with Ricardian model (Eaton-Kortum).
* Demand for good $j$ in country $k$:
\[
T^{j\to k} = \frac{(\tau^{j\to k} p^j)^{1-\varepsilon}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\tau^{i\to k} p^i)^{1-\varepsilon}}E^k
\]
* Add up across all $k$s to get total production:
\[
E^{j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(\tau^{j\to k} p^j)^{1-\varepsilon}E^k}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\tau^{i\to k} p^i)^{1-\varepsilon}}
\]


== Deriving the gravity equation ==
* Substitute out $p^j$.
* Express in terms of the usual gravity terms:
\[
T^{j\to k} = \frac{E^kE^j}{E^w}\left(\frac{\tau^{j\to k}}{\Pi^j P^k}\right)^{1-\varepsilon}
\]
* $\Pi^j$ is the average trade cots of a typical ''producer'' in country $j$:
\[
\Pi^j = \left[\sum_k \frac{E^k}{E^w}\left(\frac{\tau^{j\to k}}{P^k}\right)^{1-\varepsilon}\right]^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]
* $P^k$ is the average trade cost of a typical ''consumer'' in country $k$.
\[
P^k = \left[\sum_j \frac{E^j}{E^w}\left(\frac{\tau^{j\to k}}{\Pi^j}\right)^{1-\varepsilon}\right]^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]

== Bilateral trade costs ==
* The higher $\tau^{j\to k}$, the lower the trade between countries $j$ and $k$.
\[
\frac{\partial \ln T^{j\to k}}{\partial \ln \tau^{j\to k}} = 1-\varepsilon
\]
* The higher the elasticity of substitution, the stronger the trade impact of trade costs.
    * Why?
* Estimates of $\varepsilon$ range from 2 to 10.

== Bilateral trade costs ==
* Trade costs are not often measured directly.
* Instead,
\[
\ln \tau^{j\to k} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1\ln d^{j\to k} + \gamma_2 Z^{j\to k} + u^{j\to k}.
\]
* Hence loglinear gravity equation:
\[
 \ln T^{j\to k} = \beta_0+\beta_1\ln E^j + \beta_2\ln E^k -\beta_3 \ln d^{j\to k} - \beta_4 Z^{j\to k} + \tilde u^{j\to k}.
\]
    * What is $\beta_3$?
    * What is included in $\tilde u^{j\to k}$?
    
== Multilateral trade costs==
* The terms $\Pi^j$ and $P^k$ capture ''multilateral resistence'':
    * A consumer in a distant, secluded island pays high prices on almost everything.
* Only ''relative transport costs'' matter.
    * For this consumer, a transport cost of 20\% may not be that high.
* Because of their nonlinear nature, it is difficult to estimate these average trade costs.


= Estimates of trade costs =
== Estimates of trade costs ==
There are three ways to estimate trade costs:
    1. direct measures
        * transportation costs and time
        * tariffs etc
    2. indirect estimates from trade volumes
        * trade is lower
    3. indirect estimates from prices
        * prices are higher


== Direct measures ==
* Price quotes from shipping companies.
* Observed trade costs on actual transactions.
* Prices (and values) are often recorded at multiple ''parities'':
    * ex works (EXW): good has not been moved yet
    * free on board (FOB): good is loaded onto ship
    * cost, insurance, freight (CIF): good is delivered to destination port
    * (plus many others)
* Exports are usually recorded at FOB.
* Imports are CIF.

\widefigure{costimp}{Costs of container imports}


== Direct measures ==
* US import data contains values both at CIF and at FOB. 
* The difference is insurance and shipping.
* Hummels (2001, wp) relates these shipping costs to distance, mode of shipping, industry etc.
* In ''ad valorem'' terms, they vary between 3-4\% (computer and office equipment) to over 20\% (coal, gas, fertilizers). 
    * Table 1 here.

== Indirect shipping costs ==
* There are all kinds of nonpecuniary costs involved:
  1. time
  2. administration
  3. reliability
* The World Bank collects data on these from 181 countries (doingbusiness.org).

= Indirect inference =
== Indirect inference ==
* We can infer trade costs indirectly from trade volumes as follows.
* Suppose we believe that 
\[
\ln \tau^{j\to k} = \gamma Z^{j\to k},
\]
where $Z$ is some observable (do countries $j$ and $k$ speak a common language, do they have a common currency etc).
* Plug it into the gravity equation
\[
 \ln T^{j\to k} = \beta_0+\beta_1\ln E^j + \beta_2\ln E^k - \delta Z^{j\to k} + \tilde u^{j\to k}.
\]
* The effect of $Z$ on trade costs:\[\gamma = \delta/(\sigma-1).\]

== Issues with indirect inference ==
1. Our model may be incorrect. (For example, complete vs incomplete specialization.)
2. The error term may not be orthogonal to $Z$. 
3. We can only identify ''slopes'', not ''levels''.


== Examples of indirect inference ==
* Anderson and van Wincoop (2004, JEL) provides a survey of trade cost estimates.
* Ad valorem equivalents:
    1. different languages: 7\%
    2. different currencies: 14\%
    3. national border (as opposed to state/province border): 28\%
    4. non-adjacent countries: 8\%




= Appendix =
== CES review ==
* Take the following CES utility function:
\[
u(x_1,x_2) = \left[x_1^\alpha+x_2^\alpha\right]^{1/\alpha},
\]
and define $\varepsilon=1/(1-\alpha)$, $\alpha=1-1/\varepsilon$
* Maximize utility subject to prices $p_1$ and $p_2$:
\[
p_1x_1+p_2x_2 = E
\]
* What is the relative demand for $x_1$ and $x_2$?

== Utility maximization ==
* The marginal rate of substitution
    \[
    \frac{u_1}{u_2} = \frac{x_1^{\alpha-1}}{x_2^{\alpha-1}} = \left(\frac{x_1}{x_2}\right)^{-1/\varepsilon}
    \]
* In the optimum, this equals the relative price, $p_1/p_2$:
\[
\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)^{-\varepsilon}
\]
* The relative demand is loglinear in relative prices.
    * The elasticity of substitution is constant at $\varepsilon$.

== Cost minimization ==
* In parallel, we can solve the cost minimization problem.
* Minimize $E = p_1x_2+p_2x_2$ subject to $u(x_1,x_2)=u_0$.
    * FOC:
    \[
    p_i = \lambda x_i^{\alpha-1}
    \]
\[
E = u_0\left[p_1^{1-\varepsilon}+p_2^{1-\varepsilon}\right]^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]
* The term
\[
P \equiv \left[p_1^{1-\varepsilon}+p_2^{1-\varepsilon}\right]^{1/(1-\varepsilon)}
\]
is the ''ideal price index''.
